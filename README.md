# Quantum Earth Systems Architecture: Node-Based Upgrade

This repository serves as the root architecture for Quantum Earth, a decentralized, quantum-inspired system. It orchestrates all core components, including:

- **Quantum Core**: Handles quantum AI state management and evolution.
- **Intelligence Core**: Implements multi-agent collaboration and decision-making.
- **Encryption Core**: Provides secure data communication and validation.
- **Data Integration**: Real-time APIs and IoT integration for environmental data.
- **Pipeline Coordination**: Connects all components and ensures seamless operation.

## **Node-Based System Design**

Each node in Quantum Earth operates autonomously, handling:

1. **Quantum Processing**: Executes Quantum Core functions.
2. **AI Collaboration**: Uses Intelligence Core for decision-making.
3. **Data Security**: Enforces Encryption Core protocols.
4. **Synchronization**: Exchanges validated data with global nodes.
